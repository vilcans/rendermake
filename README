RenderMake provides a Makefile for compiling shaders, creating textures
and rendering using a RenderMan renderer.

Example
-------
A project with a RIB file (hello.rib), a shader (plastic_deluxe.sl)
and a texture (squares.tif).

Contents of Makefile:

    include rendermake.mk

    hello.tif : hello.rib plastic_deluxe.$(SHADER_EXT)
            $(RENDER) hello.rib

Run the following command:

    make --include <location of rendermake.mk>

This compiles the shader and creates the texture, then renders the image.
